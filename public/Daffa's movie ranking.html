 <h1>My Favorite Movies</h1>
 <h2>Here is my favorite movies that i still can remember :]</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>All Series of Naruto</h3>
 <p>Who ever watch Naruto in their childhood? i guess everyone who born in early 2000s love this serial. 
    This serial movies has very strong character development in almost every aspects, 
    from babies to become a great people </p>
<h3>Ejen Ali</h3>
<p>This is Malaysian product of serial animation, and that's really gooooodd. 
    Why? my reason is like why i love naruto movies. CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!. 
    That's the key to make people give emphaty to the character. 
    One thing that i don't like from this movies is the launch for every season is very sloww. Can you imagine? 
    i have been watching this serial in my elementary school and now it just has 4 SEASON until i got to COLLEGE</p>
<h3>Jumbo</h3>
<p>Firstly, i was kinda skeptical with this movies. Why? because this is one of the small amount of Indonesian product of animation. I'm Indonesian and i love local product, 
    but for your information animation industry in this country is still under-development to going as good as others. But this film totally change my perspective!
     it grows to MILLIONS OF VIEWS in the cinema. And after i saw it, i would say "THAT'S REALLY GREAT!" Graphic, sound, language, moral of the story, etc is very goood. I hope local animators can make other project like this again!</p>
